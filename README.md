# Are Data Scientists happier than other developers?


## Dependencies

 - Python 3
 - Pandas
 - Numpy

## Desription

For this project, I examine whether there are identifiable differences in the work habits and job satisfaction between developers that work in the data science / machine learning field compared to the rest of their colleagues using the Stack Overflow 2017 survey data.

I try to answer the following questions:

1. What percentage of developers are data scientists?
2. What are their working habits  relative to the rest of the developers?
    - Are their remote working habits different?
    - Are their programming habits out of work dfferent?
3. What is their job satisfaction and how is it relative to the rest of the developers?


## Usage

The dataset is too large to be included in this github repository and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-20171)

One can follow the analysis at:

* [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/jkarakas/Are-Data-Scientists-happier-than-other-developers-/blob/master/analysis.ipynb) - The jupyter notebook documenting the anaysis process using the CRISP-DSM process.

* [A medium article]() discussing the main findings.
