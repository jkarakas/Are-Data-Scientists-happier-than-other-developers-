# Are Data Scientists happier than other developers?


## Dependencies

 - Python 3
 - Pandas
 - Numpy

## Desription

For this project, I examine whether there are identifiable differences in the work habits and job satisfaction between developers that work in the data science / machine learning field compared to the rest of their colleagues using the Stack Overflow 2017 survey data.

I try to answer the following questions:

1. What percentage of developers are data scientists?
2. What are their working habits  relative to the rest of the developers?
    - Are their remote working habits different
    - Are their programming habits out of work dfferent 
3. What is their job satisfaction and how is it relative to the rest of the developers?
